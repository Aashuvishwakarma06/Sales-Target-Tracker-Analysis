##Sales Performance Tracker Dashboard (Excel Project)

*Project Description:*

The Sales Performance Tracker Dashboard is an Excel-based analytics project designed to monitor and evaluate the daily and total sales performance of sales executives across various regions.

This project uses structured datasets to calculate key metrics like Total Sales, Target Hit Percentage, and Away From Target Percentage. By combining formulas, conditional formatting, and data visualization, it transforms raw sales data into a clear, easy-to-understand performance report.

This project is a great example of how Microsoft Excel can be used not just for data entry, but also as a powerful business analytics tool to track and improve sales efficiency.
